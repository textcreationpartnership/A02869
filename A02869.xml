            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Hereby, al the powers of the soule were per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> and accomplished in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being both able and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite, for the orderly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their functions. The reason and vnderstanding
<pb facs="tcp:21891:3"/> were cleare; the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ordinate; the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall faculties, not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from euil, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to be seruiceable to good. So that reason had full power and dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the will, and the wil did gouern the sensual appetites; being the mean to hold thē in obedience vnto reason.</p>
            <p>But when, by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> originall iustice was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lost; when the image of God was defaced in man; reason, which is the life of the soule, was much enfeebled; the will was disordered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued; the sensual powers
<pb facs="tcp:21891:4"/> did tumult, and breake loose from their obedience: and haue euer since run to their obiects, with so violent a course, that commonly they draw the will after them. which also flattereth feeble reason (as <hi>Eue</hi> entised <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>) to taste of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit; euen to submit it selfe to the seruice of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; partly, in contriuing means for accōplishing that which it doth affect; &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in framing, either iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or excuse, or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the same. So that then, the first order of subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; rule being inuerted,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:4"/> or rather peruerted, subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euerted in the soule; the sensuall faculties had full dominion ouer the will; and the will did gouern &amp; guide reason; being the meane to holde it in obedience vnto sence.</p>
            <p>And although after our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> regeneration, reason, with assistance of the wil, first ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, then directed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by grace, recouereth such power ouer the sensuall faculties, that it may (in some degree) and often doth reduce them to the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their obedience; yet for the most part it happeneth,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:5"/> that it is, either weake or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to execute this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: &amp; that especially for two causes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The first is, for that the will, which is placed between reason and sensualitie, and apt to be applied to eyther, contracteth the first famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity (which commonly is most firme) with sensuality. And this is done, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our childish age, and partly also in the yeeres of our youth, in which time the will is guided by sence and is little or nothing commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reason. Whereuppon it followeth that the passions
<pb facs="tcp:21891:5"/> of sensuality, being by long custome, strong, familiar, &amp; pleasant to the will; and the first motions of reason, by reason of nouelty, weake, strange and distastefull: it geueth it selfe fully to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of sence, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes hardly recouered, to breake that amity▪ and to knit into acquaintance with reason.</p>
            <p>The second cause is, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that the sence giueth present payment of a certain shadow or shewe of good; namely, of some sensual cōmodity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: but the reward of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the true essentiall good
<pb facs="tcp:21891:6"/> which reason promiseth, and faith assureth, for a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and godly cariage of our liues, is vpō a day: nothing in presēt, but onely hope, &amp; some small earnest of the promise. Now, although wee knowe that there is no comparison betweene these in valewe, yet this false shew in such sort bewitcheth the will, that it is content to entertaine and embrace the present appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to desist from pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sute of the true future good. And thus the will being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, and drawne downe to the loue of those thinges which are pleasing to the
<pb facs="tcp:21891:6"/> sence, reason is eyther soe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereby, that it is caried in the same course of sensuality, or else remaineth so deiected in power, that it is altogether vnable to restrain the same. Eyther the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is so blinded, that it cannot discerne what it ought to doe: or the strength so disabled, that it cannot doe that which it doeth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and iudge fitte to bee done.</p>
            <p>Now, to correct this natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall eyther weakenesse or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of the powers of the soule, and to retaine them in that order of obedience
<pb facs="tcp:21891:7"/> and commaund, which is not onely iust but expedient for the soule: three exercises of Religion are, both proper, and also necessarie: fasting, medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation, and prayer. Fasting, to breake the power of sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie; meditation, to stir vp and strengthen the forces of reason; prayer to inuocate &amp; implore grace; which onely is able to rectifie the will, &amp; to curbbe and controule the sensuall appetites.</p>
            <p>The first of these, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an exercise of the body; the other two are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the soule. Fasting may oftentimes be seperated from
<pb facs="tcp:21891:7"/> meditation and prayer; and is then only to be vsed, when the body is therby made more seruiceable to the soule But meditation and prayer are inseperable twinnes; like those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> which did feede together, sleepe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ioy together, weepe together, liue together, die together: or like a paire of turtles; whereof one being taken away, the other will first languish, and afterwards die.</p>
            <p>Prayer disposeth our soules to meditation; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation supplieth matter to our prayer; both giue strēgth
<pb facs="tcp:21891:8"/> and life, the one to the other.</p>
            <p>Meditation prepareth our soules, and maketh them fit to receiue God; prayer in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiteth that glorious guest; both do entertaine him, and make him pleased therein to abide.</p>
            <p>Prayer is the speach of the soule vnto God; Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is the speech of God to the soule; both make a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conference and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing betweene God and the soule.</p>
            <p>For this cause I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured, in framing these deuotions (which are the best accompt that I can yeelde to
<pb facs="tcp:21891:8"/> the worlde of my Sabbaoth dayes employmentes) so to entermixe meditation and prayer, that they may seeme, as it were, twisted into one thredde. Alwaies to begin, and to end our meditation with prayer; oftentimes in the middest of meditation to breake into prayer; somtimes in the middest of prayer to pause vppon meditation. Which course, how comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it may bee to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and soules of other men, I doe not certainely know, I could but only make thereof coniecture by my selfe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:21891:9"/>
            <p>What hath beene my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance herein, I wil ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extenuate nor extoll. There is nothing, but the goodnesse of God, which I will extoll; there is nothing, but my owne weakenes, which I will extenuate and excuse. For other particular passages let them extol, who are priuy to their owne negligence, &amp; want of paines; let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, who will make others priuie to the same. Onely, I will adde a few wordes for aunswere to those, who make light estimation of these and the like labours, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, that they are collected
<pb facs="tcp:21891:9"/> out of other Authors.</p>
            <p>First, this argument hauing been so long, so often, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and yet neuer sufficientlie handled, and to the worth, it is impossible that much should bee saide therein, whereof much hath not been spoken by others. And yet the varietie may bee exceeding great. Euen as the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wood and of stone, is neither polished nor fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all buildinges alike.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is accounted our nicenesse, or rather neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in this pointe, wherby many writinges are like vnto the plant <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>

How liuely haue I felte the tickling of ambition &amp; vain glory, and of dissimulation seruiceable to them both? in labouring to couer my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and to make mee to seem other then I am? How greedily haue I pursued the commodities and pleasures of this life? wherein my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires haue beene so farre frō being satisfied with thine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotment, that the whole world hath seemed too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:21891:37"/> to suffice them. I haue been in some sorte, more proud then <hi>Lucifer,</hi> more presumptuous then <hi>Adam:</hi> for they being in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of beauty and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had some motiue to thinke well and presume of themselues; but I, being bred (like certaine flies and wormes) onelie of putrisac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being a vessell of most vile filth, haue notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding presumed to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee. I haue shaken off thine obedience, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed a licentionsnesse to liue according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lustes. I haue affected praise in all my actions, as though I had beene like thee, who onely art to bee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21891:37"/> praised in all thy workes: and if thou hast either cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my purposes, or not fulfilled my desires, I haue becne stirred to storme a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst thee, as if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest beene one of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes vpon iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries offered vnto mee, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouoked, and partlie light, a thicke swarme of thoughts haue made tumult within me; here upon, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue and blinde, I sought occasion of reuenge; I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied counsailes, I muste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all malitious conceites; and when I haue had no man present, I formed within my self a set contē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I considered what was
<pb facs="tcp:21891:38"/> saide or done against me, I framed both action and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thereto; exercising my minde in an idle and▪ i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginarie reuenge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I wanted both opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power. So I haue beene often carried by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse and ambition, to please my self in the vain conceites of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; alwaies immoderate, and many times impossible. In the vse of meates and of apparrell, vnder the colour of necessitie I haue prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted my pleasure, and that which would haue beene sufficient for the one, was little or nothing to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In a worde, I haue not endeauoured, either to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21891:38"/> abstaine from any pleasure, or to sustain any paine: the most light delightes haue swayed my iudgement; the most trifling troubles haue beene sufficient, not onelie to vexe, but to ouerwhelme mee.</p>
            <p>Alas, how swinishly haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
               <hi>I</hi> liued? nay, it cannot well be saide, that I haue liued at all; hauing my soule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies either buried, partlie in sleepe, and partly in sloath; or else so busied in the cares and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the false, eyther ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures or necessities of this life, that I haue euer wanted sometimes mind, sometimes time to thinke vpon thee, and to doe any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb facs="tcp:21891:39"/> the spirite and dignitie of man. O dead life! O ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure light of vnderstāding! wherewith I haue beene carried forth, forgetfull of thinges past, negligent of thinges present, improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of thinges to come. I haue not respected any thing past, but iniuries or losse; nor regarded any thing present, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of my aduerse &amp; peruerse wil; nor proiected for any future thing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge or pleasure, or else gaine. I haue beene studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I haue been industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this vnprofitable pursuit; wherein my gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes are of no better rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, then is a building
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21891:39"/> vpon sand; then an image of snow set against the sunne; then a heape of dust, subiect to dissipation by euery winde. Insomuch as I may now iustly complaine with S. <hi>Peter; I haue trauailed all day and taken nothing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the manner of my sinning against thee, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> haue so oft hardned my cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, &amp; cast away so far al shame, that I made no more scruple to sin, thē to speake; being carried against thee with such facilitie, yea bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yea contentment &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that I could not haue done more, if I had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no other life, if I had feared no iudgement, if I had belieued no God; but
<pb facs="tcp:21891:40"/> had beene perswaded, that all the pointes of Christian beliefe were meere fables, &amp; not oracled from those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine lips, that will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, that cannot erre.</p>
            <p>Let me bring the best <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of my actiōs to a true touch. All my deuotion hath been gilded with hypocrisie; <hi>I</hi> haue rather seemed then beene religious: hauing the voyce of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; the hands of <hi>Esau;</hi> in profession one, in practise another. Like vnto the serpent, which often changeth his skinne, but neuer disgorgeth his poyson. I haue entertained many vices vnder the shew and terme of vertues; as vaine science for true wise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21891:40"/> crueltie for iustice, rashnes for resolution, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize for warines, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie for constancie, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse for frugalitie, basenes for humilitie, pride for generositie, lightnes for affabilitie, presumption for hope, vnaduifednesse for zeale, distrust for feare; and generally, wanting eyther iudgement to discerne, or will to embrace the true meane, I haue alwayes run into one of the extreames; neuer endeuouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any vice, but onelie to conforme it to some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of vertue.</p>
            <p>And although <hi>I</hi> haue receiued many good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> yet was <hi>I</hi> like to
<pb facs="tcp:21891:41"/> the sea▪ which neither the riuers nor raines that fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, make any thing the sweeter; or like the leane kine which <hi>Pharao</hi> saw in his dream,<note place="margin">Gen: 41.</note> which, after they had deuoured the fat kine, remained notwithstanding as ill fauoured and leane as they were before. When I haue beene particularlie and plainely reproued for any euill, I woulde, either craftily, if not excuse, yet extenuate it; or else boldely, sometimes denie, somtimes defend it; or else maliciously reproach them who did reproue mee; or if none of these, yet did I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthākfully accept, &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regard it, or if at times
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21891:41"/> I haue beene touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with some sence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for my sinne, yet haue I not left it; and so by reiterating the same, haue prouoked thy wrath more deepely against me.</p>
            <p>If I haue set into any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> course of deuoute exercises, I haue presētly broken the thred, and intermitted the continuance thereof; soone loathing the very <hi>Manna</hi> of heauen, the true streames of paradise, and lusting again after the onions of Egypt. And as one that taketh hote coales in his hand, and pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sently casteth them away, hath no sence of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; so I haue so lightlie touched the mysteries of
<pb facs="tcp:21891:42"/> saluation, that I haue scarce felt from them any heate: they haue beene to mee as meate swallowed downe without chewing, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through mee without digestion; so farre eyther from encreasing or maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning strength, that it dooth rather endomage health. I haue wearied my selfe, I haue wasted my time, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward and backward, in rising and in falling, in building and pulling down, in rowling (as it is saide) the stone of <hi>Sysiphus;</hi> in purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and not pursuing, in attempting, and presentlie shrinking backe. I haue turned my minde (like the weathercocke) vpon the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21891:42"/> least puffe of euery occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I haue changed it (like the Camelion) into so many shapes and formes, as acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes haue beene offered vnto mee; not eonsidering how dangerous it is to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue good inspirations, &amp; not to bring them to ful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I haue worne out my whole age onely in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; I haue alwaies fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led almost in the assay.</p>
            <p>When I haue setled my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> selfe to deuotion and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, O good God! how te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious hath the time seemed, how irkesome hath the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise been vnto mee? how dul, drowsie and lumpish haue I beene therein? how were my thoughts distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<pb facs="tcp:21891:43"/> what hast haue I made vntill I had giuen ouer, to attend some other businesse or delight, which was more agreeable to my taste and liking? By this meanes my prayers haue been, like the drinke which was offered to my Sauiour vppon the Crosse; wine mingled with mirrh and gall: and I haue beene as one of <hi>Pilates</hi> seruantes, who bowed their knees vnto Christ, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him King; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with smote him, &amp; spat in his face.</p>
            <p>When I haue done good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> vnto any man, I haue not forborne to boast thereof, like vnto the henne, which cackleth at euery egge that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21891:43"/> she doth lay: insomuch as the thiefe of vaine-glory hath stoln away the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that which I haue done. In performing any other good worke, with what coldnes haue I beene carried? with how many eyther errors or defectes hath it beene fraughted? And if it bee true that thou regardest, not so much the action as the intent, how many of my workes haue beene so free from vaine respects, that they shoulde be, I will not say accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but tollerable in thy sight? for I find that I haue beene moued to doe them, somtimes at the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of other, sometimes for
<pb facs="tcp:21891:44"/> custom &amp; for maners sake; sometimes for my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular either estimation, or contentment; neuer sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the loue and seruice of thee. I haue neuer ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loued or serued thee alone, because I haue not loued and serued thee for thy selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> If I haue busied my self in talking or meditating vpon diuine matters, it hath been rather in curious questions, then in pointes eyther ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to instruct, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to stirre me. I haue beene more studious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire where hell is, thē how to auoide it: I haue beene more carefull to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee shall know one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21891:44"/> in heauen, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careful or painful how to come there. I haue beene forward to learn, what thou hast not esteemed necessary to teach; I haue had eares to listen, where thou wouldest not haue a tong to speake. To conclude then as I begā; If I examine my actions, if I weigh my wayes, if I trie the footsteps that I haue troden, I shall not finde any one of them; one is a smal number, and yet I assure my selfe, I shall not find any one, that may bee iustified in thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> sight. My beginning was corruption; my cōtinuance hath beene sinne; my ende shall bee death, the reward of sinne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:21891:45"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> O sinne! the death of the soule, and the very life and soule of death; I would not repell thee when thou diddest present thy felfe vnto mee, and after enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement I am not able to expell thee. O voide of all sparkes of pietie! O worthy to be lamēted with nō other teares, then were shed for the destruction of Ierusalem! miserable is the day of my birth, but more miserable shall bee the day of my death: for then all the delightes of this life, will be turned to a smoake, to a shadow, to a dreame, to nothing; and then will bee the beginning of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting torments.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:21891:45"/>
            <p>My soul is weary of my wicked life; I grieue to liue, and I feare to die. What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> then shall I do, perplexed sinner, but absolutelie nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in a maner both? euen to die so long as I liue: to liue, I say, in lamenting the errours of my life, and to consume all the parts of my life which are to come, in bewailing euerie parte thereof which is past.</p>
            <p>I will therefore esteeme both the pleasures and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments of this present life, my most deceitfull and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering enemies. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce onely, when I can bee sorrowfull for my sinnes: when all dishonours and punishmentes doe runne
<pb facs="tcp:21891:46"/> vpon mee for the same. I will also take armes against my selfe, and be cruelly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, both in punishing and despising this vile dunghil, the stink whereof I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to endure. In all things I wil seeke nothing but the honour of God, &amp; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and confusion of my selfe. And because I alone am not sufficient to abase and abhorre, my selfe as I haue deserued (because man being in himselfe either sin or no thing; who can descēd to the bottome of his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and contemne himselfe as these two require?) I will therefore craue aide of all the creatures in the world, and will desire to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21891:46"/> by them, for so much as I haue done the like to the Creator of them all. I will pray and prouoke all men to take compassion vpon me, and wil loue them with true affection that shal help me herein</p>
            <p>But, it is a greate increase <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> of my mesery, that I am not yet so sharply touched with sorrow, as both my present distresse &amp; imminent daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers do vrgently require. It greiueth mee that I am not sufficiently grieued for my sinnes; but do still go on so carelessely affected, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the delightes of this Worlde soe securelie; as though I were vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant of my owne condition,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:47"/> as though I had already pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed the day of my death, the day of my accoumpte; as though I had already esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the paines of hell, and did euen now raigne with thee in the state of glory.</p>
            <p>What dost thou, O vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable soule? O sinneful! O sencelesse soule, wherefore art not thou more liuely mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued?

Thy sins do wrap thee in the wrath of God; and thy death, thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thy torment is at hand.</p>
            <p>O condition! O times! And how then sleepest thou, O
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21891:47"/> dull Soule? not dull but dead if thou startest, if thou tremblest not at the sound of these terrours, Drie and withered tree, worthie to be cutte downe and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that fire, which doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes burne and neuer cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, where are thy fruits?

            <p>But howe dare a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte any Sinne to bee small? Is not euery sinne by

            <p>And can it bee a small offence to dishonour, to despise so great a Maiestie? &amp; one that is so exceeding both beautiful in himselfe, and beneficiall towardes thee? Consider then O wretched soule, eyther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously blind, or groslie ignorant, what an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable iniurie thou offerest vnto God by euery sinne, which wittingly thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est commit, and that as wel in regard of him, as also in regarde of thy selfe.</p>
            <p>In regard of God eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne is extreamely iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, by reason, partly of the contempt, and partly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21891:53"/> of the hatred which by that means is occasioned against him.</p>
            <p>For, as in euery other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, so whensoeuer with aduisement thou giuest cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vnto sinne, thy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing entreth into an actuall deliberation, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at al times thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not discerne it) in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sweetenesse of the sinne which thou art about to commit, with the fauour and friendship of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, which therby thou must assuredly loose. And hauing deliberately exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ballanced them both, thou reprouest the wisedome of God, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest off thy obedience to

            <p>Now, what greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie can bee imagined, then thus vilely to valew the maiestie of God, to which as to their last ende all men ought to referre their actions, as to prefer a vaine point of estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a trifling delight or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage before it? and (as

            <p>And it is not onely a carelesse contempt which a sinner beareth against the maiesty of God, in valuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> euery vanity aboue him; but therewith also such a cruell hate, that hee woulde (if hee were able) disarme him of his authority, pul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his power, and euen cast him out of his state: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wishing (howsoeuer hee carrieth his countenāce and speech) that there were no immortality of the soul, no account of our actions,

            <p>Hereupon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conclude,<note place="margin">Pro. 13.21</note> that sinne maketh men miserable; and that they who commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hate their own soule.<note place="margin">Psal. 10</note> Because by embracing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> sinne the soule looseth; first, the grace of God, with all the vertues and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the holy Ghost, (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the comfortable gueste of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) which do vsually ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attend or as companie that grace: Secondly, it is cast out of the fauour of God; whereby it looseth, first, his protection and prouidence in matters of

And vpon the priuation of all this good, it standeth necessarily posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with three contrary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. First, that it is made subiect vnto sinne, with all the impurities and horrors (especially, the sting of a guilty conscience,) which do vsually attend or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the same. Secondly, that it remaineth in this life in the power and possessiō of the Diuel, who ordereth all the actions thereof, who directeth whatsoeuer it doth. Thirdly, that hauing renounced Christ, and made it selfe a persecuter of him,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:59"/> defiling and treading vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote his most precious blood, it is engrossed in the booke of perdition, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in terrible expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iudgement and fire.</p>
            <p>And that thou maiest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> not, O secure soule, eyther maruaile or doubt, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment should bee inflicted for a temporall offence, consider further, that euery sinne is so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely both heinous in it selfe, and hatefull vnto God, as it is impossible for any mortall wit, eyther to vtter or vnderstand. The reason hereof consisteth in two pointes; the one drawn from the goodnes of God, the other frō his greatnes.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:21891:59"/>
            <p>For the goodnesse of a partie as it doth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> the qualitie of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence offered vnto him, so doth it cause in him an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of euill, answerable in proportion to it selfe: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the better any one is, the greater is an offence committed against him, and the more doth he hate and abhorre any euill.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good, so is any sin against him infinitely euil; so doth hee infinitely both loue vertue and hate vice; and so will hee infinitely in the ende, recompence the one; and punish the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And hereby an errour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth;
<pb facs="tcp:21891:60"/> wherewith many are possessed, who, because God is mercifull and good, are emboldned to presume to perseuere in their sinne. Assuredly, God is mercifull, and therefore to be praised; God is good, and therfore most worthy to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and obeyed. If thou doest dishonour so good a God, the more thou shalt extol his goodnes, the more doest thou aggrauate thine own offence; thou doublest thy euill in making his goodnesse the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It is the part of iustice to defend the dignity of this goodnes, and not to suffer so high an iniurie to passe vnpunished.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:21891:60"/>

For, seeing thou O Lord, art a bottomles depth of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, an endlesse Ocean of mercies, as thou art liberall in rewardes, so art thou pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in reuenge: alwaies thy rewards are greater thē our labours, &amp; thy punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes alwaies lesse then our euill.

            <p>But wherfore diddest thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> pray (O my Sauiour) that if it were possible this cuppe might passe from thee? Did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou not willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy selfe in sacrifice for sinne? O desirously.

            <p>Assuredlie, the paines which our Sauiour in body did endure, were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great; yet nothing comparable to the tormēts of his soule. In bodilie

<pb facs="tcp:21891:79"/> with whips, they did not then presse a crowne of thornes vpon his heade; it was not the nailes, not the spear, which the did pierce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him: but thy offences did thus afflict him, thy sinnes were the sad burthen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which so greuouslie he did sweate. For, then were represented vnto him the sinnes of the whole world, both past &amp; to come; which to him, who bare so great loue and zeale to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his father, coulde not but worke vnspeakable griefe. Also hee beheld the ingratitude of many, who woulde not endeauour to make profite of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite; which was a sharper

            <p>O my Sauiour, now did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou bend to vndergo thy burthē; now begannest thou to dip thy garmentes in bloud. Thou diddest lay vpon our shoulders a light burthen, and a sweet yoke; but wee laide vpon thee so heauie a loade, that none but thy selfe was able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> beare.

            <p>O heauenly Father, what is this, that thy Sonne, thy innocent Sonne, thy onely
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21891:80"/> Sonne; thy Son in whom thou art wel pleased, in this humble and heauy manner laboureth before thee? The Fathers hoped in thee, and thou diddest deliuer them; they called vpon thee, and were not confoūded: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then is thine innocent and onely Sonne, begotten of thy substance, forsaken of thee? wherefore art thou so seuere vnto him? so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull a Father, to so good and louing a Sonne. Is not thy wrath appeased, with this miserable spectable of him that is so deare vnto thee? this bloody sweate, whereof euery droppe is of greater value then all the Treasures of the
<pb facs="tcp:21891:81"/> worlde, is it not a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent satisfaction for our sinnes? a sufficient price for our redemption? O ad, mirable iustice! these were the light skirmishes to the maine battell which did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue. Thy eyes, O holie Father, were sixed vppon the Crosse; whereto vntill thy Sonne was fastened, thou wouldest not bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, thou wouldest not bee appeased. For so thou haddest before ordained, that death which was the curse of sinne, must also bee the punishment of thy Son; that the Diuel who preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a tree, should likewise by a tree bee subdued.</p>
            <p>O sweet Sauiour, what
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21891:81"/> a painefull purchase hast thou made? what a sharpe price hast thou payed for my redemption? how intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable (may I thinke) was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> the ende of thy sufferinges, whereof the entrance was so admirably straunge? and how cruell were those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to bee endured, which were so terrible in being expected? O my soule, let the sight of thy sinnes draw some droppes of teares now from thine eyes, seeing they did drawe so many droppes of bloud from euery part of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers body. Take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle touch of that griefe, which did lie so heauy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, whose power su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth
<pb facs="tcp:21891:82"/> the heauens, that it made his soule heauie vnto the death; being so deepe drowned in the nature of man, that he seemed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that hee was God. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse thy selfe, (O my soule) nay, condemne thy selfe of sencelesse dulnesse, if thou take not a deepe impression of sorrowe, both for loue to thy Sauiour, and for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> to thy sinnes; the one for enduring for thy sake, the other for requiring so sharpe a remedy. Be not in this point like vnto the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that were with Christ who fel into a soūd &amp; secure sleepe, whilest their maister both watched &amp; sweat for their redēptiō; like a louing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21891:82"/> Father, whoe laboureth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to feed his childrē whilst they remaine free, both from trauaile &amp; care. Or if I bee so drousilie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, wake mee, sweete Lord, with thy heauenlie voice; and if that will not serue, pinch mee then with some kind of punishment, that I may watch and pray, least I fall into temptation</p>
            <p>And, O good Iesu, by this greiuous agony which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> seazed vpon thy soule, by this terrour and tremblinge which wholie possessed thy holie fleshe; by all the paines wherein thou wert plunged for mee, detestable sinner, I most humbly bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee; that in the last

O sweete Lord; in that houre of leauing the world, do not thou leaue mee; in that fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, doe not thou forsake mee; but send thy holy An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gel to assist mee, to minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courage and comfort vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to mee.

And as the body of a man abideth at a stay, although his shadow be at one time long, and at another time short: so hee retained the same constant
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21891:103"/> courage, both in the sweet gale of the applause of mē, and in the bitter blastes of their opprobrious outrage: expressing still, a modestie in the one, and a grauity in the other. Trees well roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do beare all stormes; the wind tosseth, not the wheat but the chaffe: and vaine eyther honour or infamie moueth no man, who is not eyther light or weake.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And it is meet that we should liue in subiection of loue; for whatsoeuer is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is loue, or pertaineth vnto loue: and nothing is so precious as a soule that loueth, but only God who giueth loue. Loue is the Queene of all vertues. It is the end of all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and counsailes of God. Yea, all creatures are made seruiceable vnto man for this end. It is the soule, life and perfection of other vertues; the stone, which turneth all that it toucheth into gold; the stampe, which maketh all our coine currāt with God. Insomuch as if we loue, we may do what
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21891:114"/> wee will; for whatsoeuer is done in loue, God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Yea, by louing the good actions of other men, (by reason of the communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of the Church) we make them our own. It is a sword to cut in sunder the sinewes of all vices, and a spurre to stirre vs vp to all vertuous atchieuments. It is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine measure, as well of perfection which the iust haue in this life, as of glory which they shal haue in the life to come. <hi>If</hi> I <hi>haue not loue,</hi> (sayeth Saint <hi>Paul) I am nothing;</hi> for God wil giue vnto euery man, according to the proportion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee offereth himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by loue. Lastly, it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteth
<pb facs="tcp:21891:115"/> vs vnto God; for loue is a meane, which knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth two extreames, the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and that which is loued, into one. Doe wee loue the earth? wee are earth: doe we loue God? what shall I say? are wee God? assuredly we are combined with God. Yet this vnion is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> but spirituall; not trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the nature of man, but chāging his affections, and whole manner of life. that as the shadow follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bodie, so the will of man adhaereth to the wil of God, louing and hating as he doth prescribe; without any respect vnto himselfe, but onely to the honour of God. For, as iron cast into
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21891:115"/> the fire, taketh the nature of fire, and yet ceaseth not to remaine iron; so he that burneth in the loue of God, is partaker of the puritie and sanctitie of God, &amp; yet abideth still man.</p>
            <p>O loue, the roote of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> vertues; the daughter of grace, the mother of sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, the mistresse of truth; the glasse of religion, the ballance of reward, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage garment, the key of Paradise; the strength of those that fight, the crown of those that conquere; the felicitie of Saintes, the ioy of Angels, the terrour of Diuels. Without thee, faith is dead; hope a vaine presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; holinesse, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
<pb facs="tcp:21891:116"/> zeale, furie: with thee a man standeth, in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties humble; in aduersities se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure; in hard passions strōg; in good workes cheareful; in temptations safe. Are we poore, and able to giue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? are we eyther ignorant or weake, and able to doe little? let vs loue much, and that will be a supplie vnto both: for he that loueth, is of abilitie to doe much; and hee giueth much who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himselfe.</p>
            <p>Is it not meete therefore that wee sell all that wee haue to purchase this pearle? can any thing bee too deare to giue? can any thing be too hard to suffer, that wee may obtaine it? Is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21891:116"/> it a small matter that it is saide; <hi>God is loue?</hi> Is it a smal matter to dwell in God,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>O diuine vertue, so often, so greately, but neuer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough commended; O sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred loue, which alwayes burnest in the bosome of God. I cannot value thee to thy worth, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Although by inno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cency he was free, yet by loue hee became intangled in debt. For his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, God was wel plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed in him; but for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities:
<pb facs="tcp:21891:135"/> hee iustlie gaue way to his wrath against him. He was iustly charged, not with that which he had done, but for that which he did vndertake. we in iustice, shoulde haue beene smitten with these sorrowes: this blow in iustice was bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs: but he in loue step<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped betweene the blow and vs, &amp; receiued the full dint thereof vpon himselfe.<note place="margin">Esay. 53 4.5.6.</note>
               <hi>He tooke vpon him our infirmities, and bare our sorrowes, he was wounded for our iniquities and broken for our transgressions. The chasticement of our peace was laid vpon him, and with his stripes were we healed. All we as sheepe were gone astray, and turned euery man to his owne
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21891:135"/> way, &amp; the Lord hath laid vpon him the iniquity of vs al.</hi> So thē it was his loue, &amp; his fathers iustice, that cast him into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> these extremities. Loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treted that sinners might be saued; &amp; iustice exacted that sin might be punished; to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie both which suits, the mean was found, that one vnspotted Innocēt, not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death, &amp; yet willing to die; who was without sin, &amp; yet able to make satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for sin, should thus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly suffer for all offenders.</p>
            <p>This, O Lord, is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thy debt; this is the cause of thy condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Innocency maketh thee free, but loue hath brought thee vnder charge of our
<pb facs="tcp:21891:136"/> accounts. In innocencie, thou art purer then the starres, but loue hath plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thee in the depth of our deformities. By the greatnesse of thy loue, our sins haue so iled the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thy innocency. And therefore, although <hi>Pilate,</hi> respecting thy desert, could finde in thee no cause of death; yet wee, respecting thy loue, doe finde so many causes thereof, as there are sinnes in all the world.</p>
            <p>Come hither then, &amp; I will, tell you in a worde, the cause of his sentence. It was not for his fault, but it was for his loue; his loue &amp; our faults were the groūd of this iustice. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21891:136"/> both so ardently, and such sinners as wee, was iustly condemned.</p>
            <p>O my soule, what a force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prouocation is this vnto thee, not onely to loue thy Sauiour, but to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thy assurance in him. For, how is it possible, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> thou sholdest not loue him, who reiected his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, and subiected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to this miserie, to saue thee? O good Iesu, O health of my soule, haue mercy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> me, I beseech thee, and helpe me; strike this fire within my hart; let my soule be satiated with thy sacred loue. Thou art (O Lorde) my full felicity, my last end, the marke whereat I aime,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:137"/> the porte whereto I saile, the terme, the rest of all my desires. Wherefore then doe I not loue thee? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe I not desire thee with that ardencie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all creatures doe loue and desire the place of their rest? The fire, and the aire do ouerthrow mountaines, rend vp rockes, shake the whole earth, to breakeforth to their naturall place: and wherefore do not I breake through all impediments? make way through al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to come vnto thee? who art the only place both of my refuge and rest? O my desire, O my hope, my sweet solace, my assured strength; wrap my soule in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21891:137"/> the flames of thy loue, that all carelesse coldnesse may be consumed thereby: pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it so entirely with that diuine fire, that I may haue no sence of any worldlie thing. Most sweet, louing, beautifull, noble, rich, wise, glorious; and worthy to be both loued and adored; O life of my soule, who didest die to giue me life; who did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest die to kill death; morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me wholy, euen my wil, and all my euil inclinations, and whatsoeuer is mine, within me. Then reuiue me againe in thy liuely loue, by vniting all the faculties of my soule vnto thee, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them obedient to thy will.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:21891:138"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seeing also thou hast (O my soule) so rich a treasure, &amp; so liberall a distributer of the same, how is it possible, that thou shouldest not rise in hope? Iustice hath foūd a way to strike the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and cannot mercy find a meane to saue the guiltie? Assuredly, yes. For it is a greater miracle that God was condemned and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then that man shoulde be acquited and liue. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue the greater, we haue no cause to doubt of the lesse Iustice hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted her seuerity vpon the innocent; &amp; mercy will shew her fauour vpon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. Yea, if it was iustice, that the innocent shoulde
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21891:138"/> be condemned &amp; executed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> for satisfaction of sinne; it is Iustice also, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for whom hee suffered should be discharged. It is Iustice, I say, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal should be discharged of that debt, which the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie suretie hath freelie paid. Therefore, although grace is not due to a sinner, as he is a sinner; yet is it du to him as he is redeemed. It is mercy that a sinner should be saued, in respect of the sinner; but it is iustice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Christ. The iust was handled as a sinner, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might bee accepted for Iust. and it is not agreeable to the rules of iustice, that one offence should be twice
<pb facs="tcp:21891:139"/> punished; that a debt once paide, should be exacted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Hee hath ioyned, hee hath vnited himselfe vnto vs: as he cannot bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned again, so cannot we likewise be condemned; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we breake vnion, and willinglie fall from him.</p>
            <p>Further, it cannot bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> how acceptable to his Father was, the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, patience, humility &amp; loue, wherewith hee offered himself to this opprobrious death; to restore his Fathers honour, and to worke the redemption of mankinde. Seeing therefore his merits are inualuable, and that all are referred to the saluation of our soules, there is no
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21891:139"/> doubt but the same shall be obtained. The Father will not deny him that, for which he did so grieuously afflict him. This is the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the Lord hath made with our <hi>Noah:</hi> the floude of his fury shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againe vniuersally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue vs; he wil neuer hold backe his mercy frō those, for whome his sonne dooth intreate mercy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, as <hi>Adam</hi> for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one forbidden tree <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in Paradise, was iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the vse of the rest, whereof before hee was permitted to eate; so when God permitted the diuel, as his Goaler &amp; executioner, to arrest, by his Sergeant
<pb facs="tcp:21891:140"/> Death, al the sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> because his issue was attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; his whole bloud cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by that offence: but with exception, that if any were innocent and free frō sin, he should not be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Diuell by laying an vniust gripe vpon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, who was without spot of sin, is iustly depriued of the power, which before he had ouer all others. He hath brokē his teeth, he hath left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> his sting in that vnspotted body; yea, by stinging ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as often doth the Bee) he hath slaine himself. Hee is now no longer able to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>force; only he suggesteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill aduice, wherby he sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth some vnhappy soules,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21891:140"/> and entangleth thē within his nets. But Christ againe, hath giuē vs so large light, both by doctrine &amp; by exā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the supply of his grace also is so sufficiēt; that these corrupt counsails may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be, discerned by the one, and auoided by the other.</p>
            <p>I he sētence of death being once giuen, forthwith the crosse was prepared. &amp; then they brought forth Iesus, &amp; laid that heauy tree vpō his shoulders, which had beene vnmercifully battered with whips before: tormenting him, not only with the sight but with the weight of that which was appointed to be the instrument of his death. Which painefull burthen,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:141"/> together with the weight of al our sins, he refused not to take vpon him; but procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his way with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible alacrity, both in loue towardes vs, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to satisfie his fathers iustice; as a true <hi>Isaacke,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wood for the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of himselfe. But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goest thou, O innocent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Lord? what hast thou to do vpō the stinking hil <hi>Calua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?</hi> which being a place of cōmon execution, is tainted with the smell of putrified bodies: thou shalt find there no sicke persons to cure, no deuils to cast forth, no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherein to teach. True Lord, but there thou shalt find dead to raise, &amp; sinners
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21891:141"/> to forgiue. Thou shalt there find many scattered sculs of executed offenders which expect thy comming; that, as the true <hi>Elizeus,</hi> thy dead bodie should restore them vnto life.</p>
            <p>What meneth this? O good Iesu, what doth it mean? that thou hast not onely made choise of an infamous death, but of an infamous place wherein thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest dye. Wert thou so ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of malefactors and sinners, that with them, and among them, and for them, and by them, and as one of them thou wouldest be cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crucified? Certainely, thy death containeth soe many mysteries, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:21891:142"/> for vs to say, thou diddest die for our sinnes; but wee are further to consi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der how thou wouldest die? which was, by the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious &amp; cursed death of the crosse: with whome also? euen with malefactors: when? in the principall strength and beauty of thy age: vpon what day? at the great solemnitie of the passeouer: in what place? on the infamous &amp; vnsauory hil Caluarie, onely made glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by thy death.</p>
            <p>O glorious Caluarie where the Prince of light did incounter and ouercom the Prince of darkenesse; whereat one instant our life for a time ended life, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21891:142"/> our death did for euer dye: <hi>I</hi> will not hereafter seek my Sauiour in the temple, but vpon thee, for in the temple hee scourged sinners, but vpō thee he died for them; vpon thee hee opened his armes to embrace them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O my soule, accompany him in his pain full passage towardes this place of his combate, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> bowe thy selfe also vnder his crosse, not vpon necessi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie and by constraint, as did <hi>Symon Cireneus;</hi> for nothing is more greiuous, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to serue, or to be serued by constraint, but freely, and chearefully; which manner of doing, is better accepted of him, then the thing it
<pb facs="tcp:21891:143"/> selfe which we doe. For, although he might cōmand vs as slaues, yet wil he haue vs intreated as sonnes. And if thou wilt take a poore ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> howsoeuer thou seest him eyther burthened or weary, forbeare not to cast thy sinnes vpon him; for woe be vnto thee; if when they naile him to the crosse, they crucifie not also thine offences with him. Feare not that hee will eyther shrinke from them, or shake them off; for he hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly declared both his courage and his care. His courage appeared, in that hee forbadde the women, which followed him, to weepe for for him; he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21891:143"/> his care, in shewing himselfe more sensible of their calamities, then of his owne.</p>
            <p>But stay heare a little, O my soule, and do not runne so fast by so high a mystery. What new thing is this, O my redeemer? Thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not speak one word to <hi>Herode;</hi> thou wouldest not answer <hi>Pilate,</hi> although thou wert vrged; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> request thou turnest thy face, and speakest to those who weep after thee. Doest thou more at the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tears of poore women, then eyther at the entreatie or commaund of powerfull men? O good Iesu, thou doest much esteeme those
<pb facs="tcp:21891:144"/> that are pittifull; seeing it was thy pleasure, that the tears of these women shold be registred in thy Gospel, and put in one record with thy blood. <hi>Herod</hi> questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned vpon curiositie: <hi>Pilat</hi> by way of autority: but the daughters of Sion wept for pure pitty. And therefore the words of the one, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched no further then vnto thine eares; but the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme drops of the other; pierced thy heart. Thou ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kest pitty vpon those, who take pitty vpō others; thou makest more account of the teares of the pittifull, then of the words of the mighty For which cause thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not onely turne and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21891:144"/> speake to these weeping wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, but thou diddest seem more sensible of their tears, then of thine own tormēts: thou diddest seeme to shew more care and compassion for their miseries, then for thine owne.</p>
            <p>O my soule, if thou hast any businesse to negotiate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> with our Lord, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dest obtaine any curtesie of him, thou maist here see the best forme of petition and and plea. For, it is better to sue vnto God with force of teares, then with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of words: a few teares are more regarded of him, then many words. Because wordes are formed by the tongue, but teares proceed
<pb facs="tcp:21891:145"/> commonly from a heart, Possessed either with griefe or with loue. Vse fewe words then, and weepe, O my soule; for this is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of heauen, this is the most stronge voyce to call vpon God. Teares ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the inuincible, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the omnipotent, and torment the diuell more thē hell fire. When teares cry vnto God, when he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by true teares, hee will not delay both to come &amp; to cōfort vs: he wil grow presently familiar with vs.</p>
            <p>But, O redeemer of my life, wherefore is it thy plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that wee shoulde not weepe for thee? Thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest weepe for thy friende
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21891:145"/>
               <hi>Laaarus,</hi> thou diddest also weepe for the stones and walls of Ierusalem, and dost thou not permit vs to weep for thee? doest thou set soe light by the losse of thy life? shall wee so ordinarily esteeme the shedding of thy blood? Or wherefore doest thou consent that we should weep for our selues, and not weep for thee? Are wee of greater value then thou? or can any of vs be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesse worthily, or more shamefully &amp; cruelly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? What shall I say, O the solace of my soul? shal I with reuerence leaue this high &amp; obscure mystery, among many other, to thy diuine iudgmēt? Or dost thou giue
<pb facs="tcp:21891:146"/> vs to vnderstand, that it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not that wee weepe for thee, if wee doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue how wee weepe? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> the right weeping consisteth, not in multitude, but in well placing of our teares. Or is it thy pleasure that we should not weepe for thy death, but for the workers of thy death? accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to which rule, we haue cause to beewayle, rather those that commit, then those that suffer outrage &amp; wrong. Or wouldest thou signifie vnto vs that our life shold be a long martyrdom a continuall crucifiing of our selues; and that we haue more reason to shewe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion for the wicked that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21891:146"/> liue then for the good whē they dye. For it is betteer to dy thē to liue amōg euil men because in death their is but one bitter morsell to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but the societie of the wicked is a continuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Or lastlie, diddest thou meane that we should not weepe for thee, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of our selues? bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our sins are soe great that we haue time little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe to lament them. and as thou art more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at our sinnes, then at thine owne sufferinges, soe thou takest greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that wee let fall teares, for them, then for thee: for if we doe not beewaile our sinnes, it little auaileth vs
<pb facs="tcp:21891:147"/> that thou hast suffered. First therfore, we must weep for compassion of our selues, and then for thy passion: wee must bewaile our offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces first, and then busie our selues in weeping for thy wounds. For, if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest suffered for thy selfe, it had bene great reason wee should haue wept onely for thee; but seeing thou didest suffer for our Sinnes, it is conuenient that we poure forth teares principally for them.</p>
            <p>Howsoeuer it is, forbid vs not, O good Iesu, forbidde vs not, I beeseech thee, to weepe for thee; for if thou doest, with teares wee will intreate thee that wee may
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21891:147"/> weepe. We will intreat thee rather not to weepe for the trayterous cittie Ierusalem, thē not to suffer vs to weep for thee. O Lord of all life, doe not onely permit, but enable vs to weepe; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> our prayses watered with our teares.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21891:164"/> from the crosse, and they would belieue in him.

            <p>Goe too, go too, you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortiue children of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mocke on, good leaue haue you in regard of

For, looke bow fast his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie doth grow, so fast doth our shame (assure you) decrease. Whatsoeuer could do vs good, he hath impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, and hath taken to himselfe whatsoeuer might doe vs harme.

            <p>But in regard of thee, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> O good Iesu, what can bee sufficiently said? To be so afflicted as neuer was any, it is exceeding much; to be despised and despighted in this affliction, what can bee more? In all calamities it is a kinde of comfort to find some compassion. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wee desire, if we cannot be deliuered, if wee cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> be eased, yet to bee pittied; to see some who condole our miserie, who wish vs well, who want not the wil but the power to relieue vs. But, these bandogges of Sathan had vtterly exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all sence of humanitie; they were so far from pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they expressed
<pb facs="tcp:21891:167"/> great pleasure, in viewing the iniurious cruelty of thē selues, and calamitie of Christ. Againe, a gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous heart is more touched with griefe, to see his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies take pleasure at his death, then to endure it: yea, oftentimes a free and noble spirite esteemeth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> so much of death as of one spitefull speech. If therfore to liue with infamie bee worse then death, what is it then with infamie to die? Againe, these iniuries and despightes were so much more sencible to the Sonne of God, by how much more then others hee had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the contrary. For, in all our calamities, it dooth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21891:167"/> much ease the paine which wee endure, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the fault which wee haue committed. But, because our Sauiour could compare these contempts, not with his fault, not with his innocency onely, but with his innumerable and inestimable deserts; hee did the more grieue at them, or rather at the malice from whence they did proceede. And further, his loue was so great for the saluation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> mens soules, that his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes were not so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto him, as to see that they did his tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters no good. It was worse then death, that his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners would take no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb facs="tcp:21891:168"/> by his death: euen as a louing friend esteemeth lesse his labour for another, then to finde it vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not accepted: or as a good mother grieueth more, at the vngrateful and vngracious behauiour of her childe, then at the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes which she endured at his birth.</p>
            <p>But what is this, O yee obstinate Iewes, which you importune the son of God to doe? would you haue him in earnest to come downe from the crosse? No, no: hee loueth it too wel; he was too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> willing to come vnto it; his patience and his constancy were greater then so. The deuill might as easily haue
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21891:168"/> perswaded him to cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self headlong frō the pinacle of the tēple, as you can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to come downe frō the crosse: he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue gone vp, if it had been conuenient so soon to come down. The crosse and hee were no new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tāce, they had bin affianced together 33. yeers before, &amp; now they haue consūmated the mariage; he hath ioyned therwith, not his hands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also his feet. Therfore you are deceiued, O ye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Iews, you are altogther blin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded with malice: hee is not fastened to the crosse, but he doth embrace it; he stayeth not because he is nailed, but rather because he is enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb facs="tcp:21891:169"/> It is not aboue his power to come downe, but it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his pleasure. His loue to the Crosse was so exceeding great, that if all the Angels had entreated him on their knees if all mē had besought him with teares, he would neuer haue departed from it aliue. Not his bitter drinke, not his nakednesse, not his tormēts, not his death, not your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, and which is more then all, not your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, coulde either hinder him from going vppe, or cause him to come downe: to saue others, himselfe hee would not saue. Although you tell him, that if he will come down you wil belieue
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21891:169"/> him, yet will he not doe it; because hee knoweth you will not make good your word. O perfidious Iewes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> wherfore doe you lie vnto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now, the neerer Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> drew towardes his death, the heauier was his Fathers hand, the waightier his wrath, the more stripes did bee double vpon him. In the garden of <hi>Gethsemanie</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:21891:183"/> he cried to his father; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible let this cup passe from me:</hi> but now, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that which then hee feared; the storm now brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him, which did but then begin to appeare; hee cried againe; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee?</hi> At both these times, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> what were eyther his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or his feares, what the tormentes of his body, what the anguish of his soule, it is daungerous to define; Wee know them not, wee may be too aduenterous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of them. But, to be altogether abandoned in these extremities, to haue no comfort affoorded, no care taken; to be bereaued,
<pb facs="tcp:21891:184"/> not onely of the helpe, but of the pitty of all, which in some degree euery man dooth finde, seemeth to bee the accomplishment of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. First, hee was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> of all earthly comfort; For of his Disciples, some betrayed, and solde him; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers forswore him; all fell away, and fled from him. And as for the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whome hee liued, working miracles, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the good that hee could, it was they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> before him; it was they, who in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his miserable estate, did most insolently insulte vpon him. It was they who when he cried out, <hi>Eli, Eli,</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:21891:184"/> did in a barbarous sorte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride him, as if he had called for <hi>Elias;</hi> it was they, who, when with extreame faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and paines, when by reason of the large losse of his bloud hee did thirst, not onely denied him a droppe of water,<note place="margin">Luk. 16</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the rich glutton in hel, but gaue him gal to redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his tormente. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> hee was depriued of all heauenly comforte, which is the true lenitiue in al do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous distresse. And this was the cause of his heauie crie; not that his friends, but that his father did then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him; not that earth, but that heauē did not yeeld him any comfort. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb facs="tcp:21891:185"/> Father did then for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sake his innocent, and only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> sonne, and yet was not the vnion betweene them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued. Hee dissolued not the vnion, but withdrewe his vision; and restrained the influēce of those beams, which might any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh the passioned powers of his soule.</p>
            <p>Many Martyrs haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> beene assailed with terrible tormentes, which they did not only quietly, but chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure. Wil you know the reason? <hi>They were not deliuered, indeed, but therewith also, they were not forsaken.</hi> For, the grace of God did minister vnto them, such sweet, and secret supply of

But in Christ, although in regarde of his infinite dignity (for that is it which setteth this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at so high a price) the least torment, although on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in body might haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> for redeeming manie worldes; yet would he not onely suffer greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes then can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; partly to manifest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> thereby his exceeding loue, in making our redemption so aboundant (for, the lesse he had suffered, the lesse would his loue haue beene esteemed) partly to awake
<pb facs="tcp:21891:186"/> our regard, and to leaue vs inexcusable if wee loue him not againe: to stirre vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to settle in him our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and hope, especially in our tribulations, &amp; most especially when wee suffer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> for his sake. But further, he excluded all consolation from him; hee receiued no comfort, eyther from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or from the earth, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frō his father, or from himselfe: euen as it is in the Psalme;<note place="margin">Psal. 38</note>
               <hi>I looked aboute me, and there was none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte me.</hi> His naked body was left desolate &amp; forlorn, like a weather-beaten tree; the force and furies of hell, tempestuous vpon him; the influence of cōfort restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

The vaile of the Temple was torne at the death of Christ, and the Temple it selfe was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe in shorte time after; and coulde neuer since, nor euer shall bee againe repaired. The transgressors of the law, by killing the giuer of the law,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21891:200"/> haue discouered the secrets, and finished the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the lawe. They may still seperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the vaile of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and of ignorance, but with the vaile of the lawe they cannot. The vaile of the law cannot couer him, who did hang naked bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would bee seene. O how happy are we that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> haue Iesus Christ for our God, whose pleasure is that nothing shoulde bee hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

If thou wilt see his workes, looke vpon the world; if thou wilt see his wil, read the Gospel. He hath not onely shewen thee his flesh, but hath opened also his heart vnto thee. He was borne in a common Inne, that all might make resort vnto him; he suffered vpon an open mount, that all might set their sight vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> him.

For if they had been still subiect vnto death, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

O glorious death, which tooke life frō death; who woulde euer haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that one death could haue slaine another? Who did euer see before, a mā fast bound, vanquish one that was at liberty? a naked man, one that was apparelled &amp; armed? a wounded man, one that was sounde? a dead mā, one that was in life? Oh! how presētly woldest thou make proofe, of the value of thy blood, and how far the force of thy death did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; seeing that vpon the crosse thou diddest giue, to the thiefe, glory; and life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vnto the dead. What is not he able to do, who giueth

            <p>Finally, as thou diddest manifest thy diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in that the high priest, who consulted against thee, did prophesie that thou shouldest die for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in that <hi>Iudas,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed thee, did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thee to be innocēt; in that <hi>Pilate,</hi> who condemned thee, declared that he found no faulte in thee: so did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou the like, in that the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thee, confessed that thou werte the Sonne of GOD.

            <p>Now, the malice of the exe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cutioners was so implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against Iesus, that this cruell death was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to asswage it; but after he had voluntarily laide down his life and soule for vs, one of them, (violating the lawe of mercy, against him, whoe neuer violated the lawe of Iustice) stroke him into the side with a speare, and forthwith there gushed out water &amp; blood; water to cleanse, and bloud

Weepe nowe no more, O my soule, but reioyce and sing praises; for now the gates of hel are bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten downe, and the chaines of death are broken in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now is the Cherubim, who kept the entrance into paradise with a fiery sword, remoued from his charge; Christ hath receiued the wound of that sword, the water which issued out of his side hath quenched that fire. Nowe is the porte
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21891:204"/> of righteousnes opened; as by man came death, so now by man came life into the world. This is the houre which was so often promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so many waies prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, soe long expected, soe much desired. By this worke, the wrath of God is appeased, the heauens are repaired, the earth is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; our sinnes are cleansed, our enemies vanquished, &amp; our soules deliuered. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this sacrifice was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> costly to him, yet was it grateful to his Father, &amp; to vs profitable. It is more glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious vnto himself, that hee reigneth in heauen; but it is more helthfull vnto vs, that he did hang vpō the crosse.
<pb facs="tcp:21891:205"/> To him, this was a day of the fiercenes of gods wrath; but to vs, it was a day of the fulnesse of his fauour: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that hee suffered, this was indeed a heauy day, but in respect of that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned for vs, it was a day of Saluation. For, it doeth not only free vs from that punishment, which by our sinnes we had incurred, but it doth restore vs to that hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py state, whereof wee were disseised by our sinnes.

            <p>All this was done against Iesus, vpon the day of the preparation of the passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

Against Iesus they made particular suit, that his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre shoulde bee made sure for three dayes, least
<pb facs="tcp:21891:212"/> his bodie might be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; because hee had saide, that within three daies, hee would arise againe to life. So they set a guarde vpon his body, and sealed the stone vpon the mouth of the sepulchre. But, when hee that would not descend from the crosse, did rise out of his graue; when he had broken the chains of death; when he was returned, with <hi>Daniel,</hi> out of the Lions den; and with <hi>Ionas,</hi> out of the Whales belly: they corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the watch to giue forth, that whilst they slept, his disciples came and stole him away and this was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; this did set them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21891:212"/> without excuse.

            <p>Further, hee hath giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> vnto vs the sacraments of the Church, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duites of grace, whereby forces are infused into our soules; to resist vice, and to insist in all the exercises of vertue.

            <p>Lastly, all the creatures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the vse and seruice of man, are so many silent Sermons to exhort vs, so many trumpets to summon vs, to lay down our weapōs of rebellion, and to yeelde our selues seruiceable vnto him: partly, by general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their obedience, in subordinating thēselues to the will of their Creator; partly, by euery particular action, wherin they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed vpon vs. For, if they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21891:222"/> bring vs any benefite, they admonish vs thereby to bee respectiue towardes their Creator, who hath made them the meanes of impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his goodnes vnto vs: if they crosse vs with any calamity, they admonish vs therby of our disobedience; which, as it first brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, diseases, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, death, labour, losse, &amp; all other kindes of miserie and molestation, so doth it daily renue the same effects.</p>
            <p>Go too then (O wretched soule) snort on in the sleepe of thy security; solace thy self stil in thy sweet sins; &amp;, the beter to deceiue thy self, smooth them ouer also with soft and tender termes. Call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:21891:223"/> pride, decency; surfetting, good fellowshippe; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, honest care; wantō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, mirth; lust, youthfulnes. Or with a more flat kind of flatterie, entitle these and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices with the names of vertue. Call pride, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; enuie, zeale; cruelty, iustice; ambition, desire of ability to doe good. Or if these colours will not take, perswade thy self, that some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> counterfaite good qualities are sufficiēt to ouershadow them. Will God be eyther blinded or mocked? Is hee not the same God that hee was frō the beginning? doth he not as much hate sin as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he did? doth he not loue iustice as wel as mercy? Thē
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21891:223"/> assuredly, what account so euer thou now keepest of the actions of thy life, thou shalt one day yeeld as seuere an account of thē, as others haue done before thee.

            <p>These means, the more also they are, the more doe they manifest the nature of
<pb facs="tcp:21891:224"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> sin; how nothing is more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious vnto God, nothing more contrarie to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. No not the deuil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Because God hateth the deuil for no other cause, but onely for sinne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if hee were discharged, hee is of a more noble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and endued with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> many prerogatiues, in a far higher degree of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie then mortal man. But, in sinne there is no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of euil; by contagion whereof other thinges also become euill. And therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> is it most detestable vnto God, as entirely contrary to his nature, and as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of those thinges
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21891:224"/> which he hath created. It is a dreadfull darkenes which no light can illuminate; it is an extreame cold which no heate can abate; and it is a very hatefull thing which the infinite goodnesse of God cannot make tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A very hard thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it seemeth to bee, which his infinite power is vnable to doe. Such a thing is sin; wherein notwithstanding wee place all our pleasure; and wherevpon all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours do busily beat.</p>
            <p>The Prophet most truely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> describeth two principall causes of sin; one, for that the sinner prayseth,<note place="margin">Ps, 10.</note> or at the least flattereth himselfe in his desires. Another, for
<pb facs="tcp:21891:225"/> that the iudgements of God are not in his sight. But, if God hath damned many millions (O my soule) for fewer sinnes then thou hast committed; if infants &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, if children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne haue not beene spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, shall the multitude of thy grieuous sinnes neuer be sentenced? neuer exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> If hee hath taken lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger day with thee thē with many others, will he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer demand his due? Assuredly, how soeuer thou art desirous to deceiue thy selfe, he is, (as hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himselfe) a hard man in exacting our accountes; and hath a heauy hande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst offenders.

I am that great enemy of thine, who (in presence of thy diuine eyes) haue committed such hainous abhominatiōs, who acknowledgeth my selfe guilty of so many grieuous crimes, that althogh I alone should endure all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which both the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and damned persons do suffer in hell, yet would it not suffice to satisfie for

            <p>And because my offences can beare no conformity with any excuse, I present my self before thee, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with no other hope, then such as doth proceede from the riches of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and with sorrow in my heart, &amp; shame in my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, do here submit my self to that goodnes, which I confesse I haue offended: neither debating nor doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how farre it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende, but reposing my self absolutely therin.

O my God, who doest inuite mee to come vnto thee, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe, I beseech thee, fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to receiue mee It is one of thy chiefest proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to forgiue and to bee mercifull, for thereby thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> declarest thy selfe to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, in ouercomming thy owne wrath.</p>
            <p>There are no sins which thy mercies do not vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably surmoūt. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although my offences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> are, in regarde of me abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and in their owne
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21891:236"/> nature hatefull, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly eyther iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or meanes irrepairea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet can they not beare such intollerable respect, as thy infinite goodnesse is not sufficient to qualifie. O infinite goodnesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore lookest thou so sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon my sinnes? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doest thou number them? wherfore doest thou so exactly waigh them? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasse, wherefore doe I see thee angrie against me? I confesse indeed, that I haue offended, I confesse also, that my offenccs are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great; but shall I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispaire? neuer; but rather take courage to call vpon thee. For, thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

Euen as, by how much men are in greatest misery and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, so much the better title haue they to aske at places of hospitality and reliefe.</p>
            <p>Who will not pittie

Come, come, sweete Samaritane, come doe thy worke, shew thy nature, exercise thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: the more wretched &amp; weake I am, the more doe thou comfort and confirme mee. Haue mercy vpon me, O Lorde Iesu Christ, haue mercy vpon me, most miserable sinner; who of my selfe am nothing, and by reason of my sinnes, am far worse thē nothing. Turn from my corruption thy pure eyes, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for thy great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies sake I say, turne away thy knowledge from my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:21891:238"/> sinnes. Not that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereby thou discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and vnderstandest all thinges, but that whereby thou doest either approue, or disalow them; whereby thou approuest the workes of the righteous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnest the reproueable deedes of the wicked. Take no such knowledge &amp; sight of my sinnes, to impute thē to me, to lay them to my charge; but rather burie them in obliuion, hide them rather with thy mercy. Looke, Lorde, vppon the creature that thou hast made, looke vppon thine owne image; looke not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my sin, which is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the deuil: or if thou

            <p>When thou wert here in this miserable world, thou diddest cast out diuels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the diseased, raise the dead: thy mercy was euer pardoning, thy wisedome teaching, thy liberalitie giuing, thy power helping.
